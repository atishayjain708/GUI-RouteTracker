# GUI-RouteTracker

This is a java app made as a part of the "Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java" course taken under Prof. Anuradha Ravi. This app tracks the path followed by the user using a UI to display the path taken by the user and providing them with choices at intersections. 

The nodes other than the immediate next node are not revelaed.
Once a node has been chosen, it changes color to indicate the same.
If one out of multiple nodes is chosen at a junction, the other nodes disappear.
History can be seperately accesssed using a button.
